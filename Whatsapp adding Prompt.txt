I want you to extend the existing automation project by adding a WhatsApp notification system.

Important Requirements:
1. NO WhatsApp API, NO Twilio, NO paid services.
2. Notifications must be sent using WhatsApp Web through browser automation.
3. Use Puppeteer or Playwright to:
    - Open https://web.whatsapp.com
    - Scan QR code manually once
    - After login, the session must stay saved
    - Search for a specific contact or group (read from .env)
    - Automatically paste a message and send it

4. When any RTI website is detected as DOWN:
      - Create a short alert message using local template system, for example:
        "⚠️ ALERT: Website DOWN\nURL: {{url}}\nChecked: {{time}}\nStatus: {{error}}"
      - Send this message to WhatsApp Web using automation.

5. Add a new module:
      src/whatsapp/
        - whatsappSender.js (or whatsapp.py)
        - helpers to open browser, load session, search chat, and send message.

6. Update the main workflow:
      checker → if DOWN → generatePost → social posting → sendWhatsAppAlert → log

7. Add environment variables in .env:
      WHATSAPP_CONTACT_NAME="YourContactOrGroupName"
      WHATSAPP_SESSION_PATH="./whatsapp-session"

8. WhatsApp Automation Requirements:
      - Use persistent session so you don’t need QR code every time.
      - Implement waitForSelector for chat search input.
      - Select chat automatically.
      - Send message by typing and pressing Enter.
      - Include full error handling (if WhatsApp not loaded, retry, etc.).

9. Add README instructions:
      - How to scan QR code once
      - How session is stored
      - How to set WhatsApp contact/group name
      - How to restart WhatsApp automation if session expires

10. Your output must:
      - Create full code for whatsappSender module
      - Integrate into the project flow
      - Update cron workflow if needed
      - Add required dependencies
      - Ensure everything remains 100% free

Build the entire WhatsApp notification feature now.
